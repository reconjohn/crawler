## [Praticial Exercise 2:Data collection using web crawler](pe.md)

In this pratical exercise, we will introduce how to collect Twitter data using a web crawler. A web crawler is a purposely designed bot for online data collection. In most cases, online data can be acquired through a dedicated API maintained by the data provider. If no avaliable API, we can use a crawler library (e.g. Selenium, Scrapy, etc.) to develop a customized crawler. Below, we will develop two crawlers to harvest twitter data. The first one is made with a python library named 'Selenium'; and the other one tries to collect data from Twitter API. Okay, let us get started!
